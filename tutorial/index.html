TaffyStudio is an interactive visual interface to Taffy,
a framework for the development of Neural Network models.
This document provides a high-level overview of Taffy's API and the TaffyStudio interface, 
then offers a number of hands-on tutorials.
</p>

<h3>The Taffy Framework</h3>
<p>
The Taffy framework allows one to represent a Neural Network model and compile it to an arbitrary backend.
Taffy's representation extends the concept of a computational graph to contain modules.
Taffy regards all computational graphs as modules, whose nodes represent operations and edges represent values.
Operations may be modules, allowing one to compose modules.
<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> illustrates how one module could implement another.
</p>



<h4>Modules</h4>
<p>
The structure of a module is simple - it has nodes, inputs and outputs, a name and a set of imported modules.
A module is primarily composed of nodes, which implement operations that take inputs and produce outputs.
A module is itself a functional object; it takes inputs and produces outputs. 
Every module has a name, which is a unique identifier that allows other modules to access it by name.
A module may import other modules by referencing their names in its imports, allowing its nodes to specify them as operations.
<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> illustrates the structure of Module B.
</p>


<h4>Nodes</h4>
<p>
A node implements an operation that may be a module or a primitive operation.
There are two forms of data the node may recieve, "inputs" and "literals".
Inputs are a values obtained from other nodes via an edge, whereas literals are values internal to the node.
For the sake of simplicity, the majority of operations only take inputs.
</p>



<h4>Inputs, Outputs</h4>
<p>
The input/output interface for nodes and modules are compatible by design.
A node takes a list of inputs and produces a list of outputs.
Likewise, when a module is run,
the supplied input values are forwarded to the input nodes,
and the values along the output edges are extracted and returned.
</p><p>
For reasons described in the <a href="#compilationsection">compilation section</a>, 
if a module is being compiled, its inputs and outputs must be tensors. 
Otherwise, if it's being implemented by a node, it may take and emit arbitrary values.
</p>

<div id="compilationsection">
<h4>Compiling a Module</h4>
<p>
A module can be compiled to one of the supported backends, e.g. TensorFlow. 
During compilation, a module is transformed to only contain tensor values, thus removing dynamic control flow.
As such, when a module is compiled, all its input and output values must be tensors.
</p><p>
Tensor values aren't actually materialized at compile time - rather Taffy operates over <b>tensor descriptions</b> 
that specify attributes like shape and data type.
To ensure correctness and evaluate control flow, the compiler must recieve descriptions of the inputs, usually in the form of tensor descriptions.
</p><p>
During compilation a module is flattened by an inline expansion procedure, 
whereby nodes implementing a module are replaced with the module's nodes.
This procedure is illustrated in <a href="#figure3">figure 3</a>.
Additionaly, any nodes that do not create tensor values that contribute to an output are pruned.
This intermediate representation is later compiled to backend code.
</p>
</div>

<h4>Creating Variables</h4>
<p>
A typical use case doesn't require users to manually instantiate variables, 
but instead use higher-level modules that do this for them.
Variables can be created using the variable operation. 
When a variable is created, it can be placed in a collection to aid in the gathering of variables, 
for example to gather variables for regularization or training.

<h3>The TaffyStudio Interface</h3>
TaffyStudio is an interactive visual interface interface to Taffy.


<h4>Creating a Module</h4>
<p>
Adding a new module and defining its name and imports can be done from the navigation bar, 
as shown in <a href="#figure4">figure 4</a>.
A new module can be created by clicking the "plus" button on the navigation bar.
This will create a new tab for that module.
This tab is not only used to navigate to the module's nodes,
but can also be used to change the module's name and imports.
The module's name can be changed by double clicking the module's name.
One can change its imports by clicking the imports button, 
which gives collections of modules that can or have been imported.
Available modules are selected so as to avoid circular dependencies.
A module can be moved between these collections by clicking on the module. 
</p>


<h4>Defining Nodes</h4>
<p>
A module's nodes, inputs and outputs can be defined from a module's nodes panel.
A node can be created by clicking on the panel, 
which will create the node and prompt a "sidebar" interface.
</p><p>
<a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a> shows a node. 
The black circles (ports) on the bottom represent a node's inputs, 
and the ports on top represent its outputs.
The text inside the node is the name of the operation it implements, 
or the name of node if its provided by the user.
To accomadate variadic functions, the sidebar allows one to change the number of input ports.
</p><p>
To populate a node's inputs and outputs, the user draws edges between an input and output port.
An edge may be deleted by clicking on it. 
As will be described in the debugging section, 
hovering over an edge will display the value flowing along it.
</p><p>
The sidebar, shown in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>, 
allows users to populate a node's attributes such as its name and operation.
The sidebar takes on different functionalities for different nodes.
For the input and output nodes, the sidebar allows one to 
change the number of inputs and outputs, populate the input descriptions, and compile the module.
</p><p>
For other nodes, the sidebar displays and allows one to edit the node's attributes such as its name and operation.
Once a node's operation is defined, the sidebar will display the operation's documentation, 
and possibly an interface for defining the node's internal literals.
</p><p>
Many modifications to the sidebar will change the module in a way that will prompt an evaluation, 
which may update aspects of the GUI such as the ports and the values attached to certain elements.
</p>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>
<p>
Evaluations are performed to update values and debugging errors in the graph.
</p><p>
When a user hovers over a port or edge, a tooltip displays the value flowing along it, as shown in <a href="#figure7">figure 7</a>.
This makes tensor operations easier to construct because the shape and type of the tensor arguments are readily accesible.
Arbitrary operations also benefit because the form and value of the arguments are queryable.
</p><p>
If an operation fails, it will throw an error with a message describing the error.
This will appear as a warning attached to the node, as shown in <a href="#figure8">figure 8</a>.
To help identify the cause of the error, one can inspect the values provided to the node.
To support nested debugging, warnings may include links to the next module in the call graph. 
Values are extracted from the stack trace and attached to the nodes in the modules involved, 
reflecting the state at the time of the error.
